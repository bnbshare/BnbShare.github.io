# BnbShare

[BnbShare](http://BnbShare.github.io) is a project to share information on Binance Smart Chain.

> The website is not the only one entry to BnbShare. BnbShare is a DApp. So you can download the html files to your own server or access the contract in other ways.

## Quick Start

There are several optional ways to use BnbShare since it is a DApp.

**Option 1 : Visit the Website**

You can just visit [BnbShare.github.io](http://BnbShare.github.io) to use BnbShare.  
Please install MetaMask or use other Tron wallets that supporting DApp browsers. Or you can only view the Shares.


**Option 2 : Download the HTML Files**

First, clone the source code from this repository (the HTML files are the same as BnbShare.github.io).  
`git clone https://github.com/BnbShare/BnbShare.github.io.git`

Then you can see the HTML files and copy the HTML files to the directory of your HTTP server.

Take [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) as an example, the files in `BnbShare.github.io/` should be copied into `C:/xampp/htdocs` or `/opt/xamppp/htdocs/`.

After that, you can visit `localhost` to use BnbShare (MetaMask or other BSC DApp browsers are also required).
